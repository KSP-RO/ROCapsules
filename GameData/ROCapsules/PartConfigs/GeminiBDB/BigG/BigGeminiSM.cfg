	description = A large 2.5m+ service module for the 1969 Big Gemini concept. Includes a large pressurized volume in the aft for cargo and crew space. This Service Module is also compatible with Apollo (although it will need a custom adapter, and the internal compartment will be inaccessable since Apollo doesn't have a hatch in it's heat shield), and the Apollo Service Module is also compatible with Big Gemini (Adapter not included). NOTE: This contains no propulsion, add RCS thrusters.
