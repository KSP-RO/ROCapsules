	@title = Dynasoar Cockpit (Alt)
	@description = Alternative Dynasoar cockpit, with a rounded nose. Dynasoar (short for "Dynamic Soarer") was an early USAF spaceplane, intended to function as a station tender, reconnaissance craft, and nuclear bomber. Designed for "Dynamic Soaring", dipping deep into the atmosphere and using aerodynamic manuevers to skip back out, or change it's orbit. This would have allowed it to make passes as low as 50 km for precision reconnaissance or bombing before returning to orbit. Although Dynasoar's hot structure TPS made it relatively durable, the same cannot be said of it's Transtage propulsion, so atmospheric manuevers are to be performed at your own risk.
